# Plethonian Calendar Web Application

An application that computes time according to the rules of the calendar
introduces by Pletho, the Greek Platonic philosopher who was the real initiator
of the Italian Renaissance.

The website is visible at [Fasti Pletonis](https://fastipletonis.eu)

## Rules of the calendar
The calendar calculates months according to the Moon cycle, and years according
to the Sun cycles, therefore the number of months in a year can be either
twelve or thirteen, while the number of days in a month is either 29 or 30.
These are the general rules:

- each month starts at the first day AFTER the New Moon;
- the year starts at the beginning of the first month AFTER the winter solstice;
- each month is divided in four weeks, with one or two days outside the week
cycle, depending if it's a 29-days or a 30-days month.
